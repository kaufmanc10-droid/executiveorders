                                                                                                    Increasing Efficiency at the Office of the Federal Register

                                                                                                    We will foster prosperity by freeing Americans from the heavy burden
                                                                                                    of Federal regulations accumulated over decades. Although the decision

                                                                                                    through a rulemaking should be simple. It is not.
                                                                                                    The Office of the Federal Register frequently takes days or, in some cases,

                                                                                                    Yet despite those delays, executive departments and agencies are charged

                                                                                                    These inefficiencies inhibit my Administration’s deregulatory agenda and
